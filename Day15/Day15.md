# Day 15
>Descriptions of both problems can be found [here.](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15)

## Part 1

A classic Djikstra algorithm does the trick for both parts of this one.

> Since I implemented this before having knowledge of maps, I use a list as a min heap, making the second part especially slow for the larger input.

To try out the solution to **part 1**, load the file *Day15.hs* in GHCI, call the function *main1*, and type in the name of the input file of your choosing (file extension included). 
* The expected output for *input1.txt* is 40.
* The expected output for *input2.txt* is 410.

> Input 2 takes a couple of seconds

## Part 2

To try out the solution to **part 2**, load the file *Day15.hs* in GHCI, call the function *main2*, and type in the name of the input file of your choosing (file extension included). 
* The expected output for *input1.txt* is 315.
* The expected output for *input2.txt* is 2809.

> Input 2 could take from 8 to 15 minutes to compute.
